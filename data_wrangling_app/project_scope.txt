you are an expert python , fullstack web and streamlit developer 
scan the folders in coding practices and use the intel to give yourself a ciding advantage 
scan my app app to get the basic idea of what the app does.
create a script that will re-run this streamlit app whem the is no activity to avoid the app sleeping on the streamlit platform in ned the app online 24/7.
add form for user with files larger than 500MB to be sent to the developer directly for data wrangling and visualization, add a special requests portion to the form for any specific instructions on how to handle the data.
the database is flawed with type errors, create a simple database with a json backend that can be queried by the user,avoid complications keep it simple.
edit the user input component on the sidebar,add a company name component, industry and country of origin or just make a form that can be submitted to the developer as well.
make sure that all the forms explain that the developer accepts PAYSHAP and PayPal payments.
the app is filled with bright colors, make the UI a bit darker with a modern business app look.
make sure your data base incorporates datasets and formats that work well in streamlit to avoid runttime,syntax and tyoe errors.
This is a MVP for my portfolio avoid errors at all costs.
finish the whole project and follow my instructions without asking for confirmation until yoou are done.
you are modifying and adding changes to the app not rebuilding the whole app so dont chang the app beyond recognition.
